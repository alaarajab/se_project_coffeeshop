# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project Desciption

The website allows users to:

- View the coffee shop's menu, including specialty drinks and baked goods.
- Explore home-brewing recipes through embedded videos.
- Make a reservation by filling out a form with their name, email, preferred date and time, and number of guests.
- Flat BEM file structure
- Learn more about the coffee shop’s mission and values.
- Connect with the coffee shop on social media through links to their Facebook and Instagram pages.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

in the future, I would like to:

- Add More Interactivity by Implementing JavaScript to make the reservation form more dynamic, such as validating form inputs in real time and displaying confirmation messages.

- Add a Backend by Expanding the website’s functionality by implementing a backend that can store user reservations and provide users with an email confirmation.
